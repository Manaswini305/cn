Go Back N Sliding Window Protocol

Source Code:

#include<stdio.h>
 
int main()
{
    int w,i,f,frames[50];
 
    printf("Enter window size: ");
    scanf("%d",&w);
 
    printf("\nEnter number of frames to transmit: ");
    scanf("%d",&f); 
 
    printf("\nEnter %d frames: ",f);
 
    for(i=1;i<=f;i++)
        scanf("%d",&frames[i]);
 
    printf("\nWith sliding window protocol the frames will be sent in the following manner (assuming no corruption of frames)\n\n");
    printf("After sending %d frames at each stage sender waits for acknowledgement sent by the receiver\n\n",w);
 
    for(i=1;i<=f;i++)
    {
        if(i%w==0)
        {
            printf("%d\n",frames[i]);
            printf("Acknowledgement of above frames sent is received by sender\n\n");
        }
        else
            printf("%d ",frames[i]);
    }
 
    if(f%w!=0)
        printf("\nAcknowledgement of above frames sent is received by sender\n");
 
    return 0;
}

Execution:

Enter window size: 3                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                
Enter number of frames to transmit: 15                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                
Enter 15 frames: 12 34 13 65 21 32 56 78 33 54 87 39 42 77 99                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                
With sliding window protocol the frames will be sent in the following manner (assuming no corruption of frames)                                 
                                                                                                                                                
After sending 3 frames at each stage sender waits for acknowledgement sent by the receiver
